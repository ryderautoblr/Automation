Innovative. Advanced. Modular. LS2's Metro reimagines the possibilities of a modern, full-face modular motor- cycle helmet. It starts with the aerodynamic shell built from our exclusive Kinetic Polymer Alloy (KPA). This super strong alloy offers exceptionally lightweight and a bit of flexibility for energy absorption with penetration resistance that rivals that of high-end composites. ;;VISOR Features:-LS2 visors are built with 3D Optically Correct "A Class" Polycarbonate, a space-age polymer with high resistance to impact, that avoids distortion and offers maximum clarity. ;;SECURITY System:-To ensure good protection the helmet must fit your head to perfection, special attention should be paid to the shell shape design and materials to minimize the effects of a possible impact. It is key to obtain a perfect fit to your head from outside to inside, as well as the shell, the configuration of the EPS liner, which should match closely the human head shape. ;;VENTILATION System :-LS2 helmets feature a Dynamic Flow-­through Ventilation. Fully adjustable intake ports and vented EPS work with the rear spoiler and exhaust ports to create a constant, light flow of air helping to keep the rider cool and comfortable. ;;CERTIFICATION:-DOT  USA's highest certification standards.;;;https://ls2helmetsindia.com/in/p/FF324-METRO-EVO-SOLID-MATT-BLACK-WITH-PEAK/341;https://ls2helmetsindia.com/userdata/public/gfx/1001.jpg;https://ls2helmetsindia.com/userdata/public/gfx/1002.jpg;https://ls2helmetsindia.com/userdata/public/gfx/1003.jpg;https://ls2helmetsindia.com/userdata/public/gfx/1004.jpg;https://ls2helmetsindia.com/userdata/public/gfx/1005.jpg;D:/Automation/websiteScraping/ls2/Ls2Photos/FF324_METRO_EVO_SOLID_MATT_BLACK_WITH_PEAK;FF324_METRO_EVO_SOLID_MATT_BLACK_WITH_PEAK_0.png;FF324_METRO_EVO_SOLID_MATT_BLACK_WITH_PEAK_1.png;FF324_METRO_EVO_SOLID_MATT_BLACK_WITH_PEAK_2.png;FF324_METRO_EVO_SOLID_MATT_BLACK_WITH_PEAK_3.png;FF324_METRO_EVO_SOLID_MATT_BLACK_WITH_PEAK_4.png

It tests as well as the best composite materials in the world and is the perfect material for a racing helmet. Ls2 uses 3 shell sizes for the Subverter to assure that you get the smallest, lightest shell possible for your specific size. In fact, this is one of the smallest shells in the business.

This layer is slick and works just like your scalp. It allows the comfort liner just a bit of slippage to help offset and diminish rotational energy and dramatically improve the dissipation of energy absorbed by the EPS. In other words, it takes energy management to a new, better level. We call it the Synthetic Slip System.
