SPEED OF THOUGHT;Rs.6,500;XL;NEW EDITION;xBhp has always been about advocating safe riding. So it was inevitable that xBhp would design its own helmet. And that happened last year in 2019 along with Axor Helmets on the occasion of 16 years of xBhp! And this year xBhp is out with the second xBhp | Axor Helmet, and we call it the Speed of Thought. We all love to speed on motorcycles. However, there is nothing faster and powerful than our own mind. And therefore we must obey the rules of the road. And that is the foundation of the design of our second helmet. The 299 shows the 'magic number' or the 'hand of God' which had been decided by the manufacturers to be the limiting speed of modern superbikes. And below that, it reminds you, that nothing is faster than your imagination. So why put your brain and body at risk by overspeeding on roads? The top of the helmet has a biker wearing the first edition of the xBhp helmet. The back retains xBhp's iconic philosophy of I, the Biker. The rest of the elements show the most important part of the motorcycle, the heart, its engine, and exhaust pipes blurting out flames, which are the equivalent of the incredible creativity the human mind is capable of outputting. The better part of the helmet shell is covered with the human brain which it protects and the lightning bolts behind accentuate the neurons inside our brain.;The helmet is designed along with The MotoGrapher and Toxic Skins. And assembled at the high-quality assembly of Axor helmets.;;Note:;1. The helmet is available in a gloss finish only.;2. The final product will be delivered with Anti-fog clear visor.;https://www.axorhelmets.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=20_27&product_id=308;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/Xbhp-22-500x500-500x500.png;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%203-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%205-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%206-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%209-500x500.jpg;D:/Automation/websiteScraping/axor/AxorPhotos/SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_0.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_1.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_2.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_3.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_4.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_5.png

SPEED OF THOUGHT;Rs.6,500;XL;NEW EDITION;xBhp has always been about advocating safe riding. So it was inevitable that xBhp would design its own helmet. And that happened last year in 2019 along with Axor Helmets on the occasion of 16 years of xBhp! And this year xBhp is out with the second xBhp | Axor Helmet, and we call it the Speed of Thought. We all love to speed on motorcycles. However, there is nothing faster and powerful than our own mind. And therefore we must obey the rules of the road. And that is the foundation of the design of our second helmet. The 299 shows the 'magic number' or the 'hand of God' which had been decided by the manufacturers to be the limiting speed of modern superbikes. And below that, it reminds you, that nothing is faster than your imagination. So why put your brain and body at risk by overspeeding on roads? The top of the helmet has a biker wearing the first edition of the xBhp helmet. The back retains xBhp's iconic philosophy of I, the Biker. The rest of the elements show the most important part of the motorcycle, the heart, its engine, and exhaust pipes blurting out flames, which are the equivalent of the incredible creativity the human mind is capable of outputting. The better part of the helmet shell is covered with the human brain which it protects and the lightning bolts behind accentuate the neurons inside our brain.;The helmet is designed along with The MotoGrapher and Toxic Skins. And assembled at the high-quality assembly of Axor helmets.;;Note:;1. The helmet is available in a gloss finish only.;2. The final product will be delivered with Anti-fog clear visor.;https://www.axorhelmets.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=20_27&product_id=308;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/Xbhp-22-500x500-500x500.png;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%203-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%205-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%206-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%209-500x500.jpg;D:/Automation/websiteScraping/axor/AxorPhotos/SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_0.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_1.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_2.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_3.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_4.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_5.png

JET LEATHER BEIGE OSTRICH;Rs.8,990;S;BEIGE;Each leather cladding is crafted by a single artisan. No animal, endangered or otherwise is ever reared primarily for hides. The existing leather goods industry generates a lot of surplus hides that are rejected because of 'imperfections' small scars or subtle variation. We believe this natural quality is characteristics of leather. We source each hide from stock and sample lots where the leather has already been tanned and is lying unused.

SPEED OF THOUGHT;Rs.6,500;XL;NEW EDITION;xBhp has always been about advocating safe riding. So it was inevitable that xBhp would design its own helmet. And that happened last year in 2019 along with Axor Helmets on the occasion of 16 years of xBhp! And this year xBhp is out with the second xBhp | Axor Helmet, and we call it the Speed of Thought. We all love to speed on motorcycles. However, there is nothing faster and powerful than our own mind. And therefore we must obey the rules of the road. And that is the foundation of the design of our second helmet. The 299 shows the 'magic number' or the 'hand of God' which had been decided by the manufacturers to be the limiting speed of modern superbikes. And below that, it reminds you, that nothing is faster than your imagination. So why put your brain and body at risk by overspeeding on roads? The top of the helmet has a biker wearing the first edition of the xBhp helmet. The back retains xBhp's iconic philosophy of I, the Biker. The rest of the elements show the most important part of the motorcycle, the heart, its engine, and exhaust pipes blurting out flames, which are the equivalent of the incredible creativity the human mind is capable of outputting. The better part of the helmet shell is covered with the human brain which it protects and the lightning bolts behind accentuate the neurons inside our brain.;The helmet is designed along with The MotoGrapher and Toxic Skins. And assembled at the high-quality assembly of Axor helmets.;;Note:;1. The helmet is available in a gloss finish only.;2. The final product will be delivered with Anti-fog clear visor.;https://www.axorhelmets.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=20_27&product_id=308;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/Xbhp-22-500x500-500x500.png;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%203-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%205-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%206-500x500.jpg;https://www.axorhelmets.com/image/cache/catalog/HELMETS/SPEED%20OF%20THOUGHT/xbhb%209-500x500.jpg;D:/Automation/websiteScraping/axor/AxorPhotos/SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_0.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_1.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_2.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_3.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_4.png;SPEED_OF_THOUGHT_C_NEW_EDITION_5.png
